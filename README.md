This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `Rules of the game

(Quick start)
-You are presented with a board of squares. 
-Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. 
-If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
-Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. 
-Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.
-To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click (or hover with the mouse and press Space).

(Detailed instructions)
-A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges.
-If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.
-The first square you open is never a bomb.
-If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win. Incorrect bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.
-You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.
-If you want to insert a flag just rightclick
-There is a restart button that lets you restart the game
-You can also review the game rules if you press the "Rules of the game" button
